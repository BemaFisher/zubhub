# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for your willingness to contribute to ZubHub!

The following are a set of guidelines to follow when contributing to this project.

## Have A Question, Idea or Suggestion?

Start by reviewing current and past issues to see if your question/idea/suggestion has already been reported or discussed before. If what you are proposing is completely new, start by formalizing the idea and create an issue in the repository. In the text, make sure you have the following sections at the very least. 1) Motivation 2) [User Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) The existing committers on this project work to reach consensus around project direction and issue solutions within issue threads (when appropriate). If it is a security issue, please do not file an issue on Github and read [this](#security-issues)

## Code Reviews

All submissions should come in the form of pull requests and need to be reviewed by project committers. Read [GitHub's pull request documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on sending pull requests.

## From Contributor To Committer

We love contributions from our community! If you'd like to go a step beyond contributor and become a committer with full write access and a say in the project, you must be invited to the project. The existing committers employ an internal nomination process that must reach lazy consensus (silence is approval) before invitations are issued. If you feel you are qualified and want to get more deeply involved, feel free to reach out to existing committers to have a conversation about that.

## Security Issues

Security issues shouldn't be reported on the repository issue tracker. Instead, mail us at admin@unstructured.studio with details about the issue including any screenshots, PoC or any other relevant detail.
